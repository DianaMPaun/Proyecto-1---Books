# Project_1---Books

This is my first project. It is about books.

How many books are in the world?

In 2010, Google tried to definitively count how many books are in the world, counting 129,864,880.

UNESCO estimates that 2.2 million books are published every year, so if we add that number to Googleâ€™s count, we can surmise that there are roughly 158,464,880 unique books in the world as of 2023.
the actual count could vary. Here's why:
	- with digital publishing growing exponentially, tracking and accounting for all of the e-books and digital publications out there is a monumental task.
	- nowadays, self-publishing your book online is easier and more accessible than ever. Unfortunately, this results in an innumerable amount of self-published books being left out of traditional publishing statistics, giving us a less accurate number of how many books are in the world.
	- orphan works (books (and other types of media) that are copyright-protected, but the copyright holder, such as an author, is unknown or unable to be contacted) are typically not included in publishing numbers, but many have amassed throughout the years.
	- throughout the years, titles across the globe have been reproduced in different editions, translations, and reprints, all of which further complicate the counting process.

Since the best we can do is an estimate, the true answer will remain an enigma. 

I love reading and I was wondering: how many read? what kind of books format they use? what genre they like most? And this is how started my project.

First, I looked for the best sales books in Spain for 2023. And also, what are the most read for 2023.
For this I scraped the Casa del Libro page, getting the information I wanted. 
I got the top best sales for the categories: Fiction, Non Fiction, "Juveniles" and Comics.
And the most read for the category Fiction.
That was a bit for me, to get new books for my to-read list. :)

But I still wanted my answers about who's reading more: young people, old? And what genre? And what format?
Well, for the global statistics I used the thgmwriters.com. 
For 2022 the statistics said:
	- most of the readers declared they read between 1 and 5 books in a year, 27% that they read more than 20 books in a year and there is a sad percentage(4%) that declared they read no books in 2022;
	- the most read genre during 2022 were History, Mystery and Biography;
	- although noeadays ebooks are very popular, during 2022 the book format most read was paperback, followed by eBooks and Audiobooks;
	- age categories: it is said to say that the age category that less read in 2022 was young, under 18. The age category that read more was between 35 and 55.
	- statistics said that women read more han men. 
 
I got all the answers I wanted :) And you can see it all in my project.

Happy reading to all!
